# SSOServiceFront

Single sign on react app as part of E_uprava class project assigment. Developed by [petar__k](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petar-komord%C5%BEi%C4%87-23765a233/)

## Getting started
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run this project you will need:
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (if you want to run app manually)
- [Docker+Docker compose](https://www.docker.com/)(if you want to run project inside docker)

To start your service you can see attached docker-compose.yaml that I wrote for all services(including this one) in [this repo](https://github.com/EUPRAVA-TIM1/DockerCompose). If you prefer to run it mannualy you can do so by running `npm start` command inside your project root folder.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

**Note: if you want to change avelable services and their redirect url's you can do so by edditing allServices array in `Data/data.ts`**
